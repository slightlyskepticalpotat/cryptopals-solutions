# cryptopals-solutions
My solutions to the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/sets/5/challenges/39) cryptography challenges, mostly solved with Python 3. They're incomplete at the moment, but I'm actively working on all of the sets. This repository also contains reference implementations for a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms that I used during the course of the challenges.
