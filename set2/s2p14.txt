Another day, another ECB exploit. I'm not sure how many more there are, either. Looks like I have to build off my previous exploit, which would be fun. I'm also [slowly] learning about the importance of writing reusable code.

The solution is to try and detect the prefix length by checking when one block crosses over to the next block, since the first block being encrypted is the prefix + attacker-controlled. After that, we can just start the attack at the second block. This attack can also be extended to multi-block prefixes.
