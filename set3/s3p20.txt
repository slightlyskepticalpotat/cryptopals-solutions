This challenge builds off the code we wrote in the previous challenge and back in set 1. If we use AES-CTR with a repeated keystream, it's essentially the same as the xor encryption that we have already broken before. Thus, we transpose the ciphertexts and use english letter frequencies to determine the most suitable byte for each byte of the keystream. After that, we can decrypt most of the plaintext and use our knowledge of english to fill in the rest.
