Another challenge focused on the Mersenne Twister. It looks like set 3 is half AES (especially CTR mode) and half mt19937, both important concepts. I've gotten a better feel for both of them, and even managed to turn one of the challenges into another project (https://github.com/slightlyskepticalpotat/mersenne-twister-tools). All in all, I think this will help me tremendously with PicoCTF which is just around the corner.
