Nothing new here, we just need to reverse all the operations of the Mersenne Twister to get the original state from 624 consecutive values. I know that this attack can be extended to most other variants of the Twister, but I'm not sure how exactly to do that. I also know that it's theoretically possible to go backwards in time to get the previous states leading up to this state, but I'm not sure how that works eitherâ€”further research is needed.
