We explore a few ways to tamper with g in this challenge, and see that g = 1, g = p, and g = p - 1 are all vulnerable to mathematical attacks. While these attacks aren't very useful on their own (as the challenge description states, if an attacker can mess with g they can probably mess with something else), it's more useful for attacks against Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, which is increasingly used these days. I even use it in one of my projects, an [encrypted chat](https://github.com/slightlyskepticalpotat/snakewhisper).
