In this attack, I learned that "pure" SRP was trivially breakable. Sending 0 or a multiple of N as the client's public key would lead to S being 0 for the server, and then the client could just log in using that knowledge. This further highlights the vulnerability of some cryptographic systems if they are used without additional checks, like how unpadded RSA can also be broken.

The challenge also mentions how "almost every implementation of SRP we've ever seen has this flaw", which is concerning for rolling your own in cryptography.
