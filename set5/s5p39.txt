Since I used Python's built-in modular inverse algorithm and pycryptodome's random prime generation algorithm, there wasn't much left for me to do. I eventually decided on just converting plaintexts to hex and then an integer to encrypt them (and doing the opposite to decrypt ciphertexts), while noticing that the key generation times were longer than just a random symmetric key, taking up to 10 seconds to generate a pair of public and private keys.
